						<h2>Go East!</h2>
						<p>A one-stop leisure and lifestyle destination, Downtown East is also a choice venue for NTUC members and Singaporeans to enjoy a wide array of entertainment options at affordable prices.</p>

						<p>From a humble beginning as just NTUC Pasir Ris Resort, it was re-developed in 2000 to become Downtown East, Singapore's lifestyle and recreational hub. Today, it is home to Costa Sands Resort and the popular water park, Wild Wild Wet. The entertainment and leisure centre E!hub opened in 2008 and added a cinema, Orchid Bowl and lots more to the colourful landscape.</p>
						
						<h3>Events & Exhibitions @ Downtown East</h3><br/>

						<p>Catering to the niche market of small and medium-sized events (1,000 to 2,000 guests), Downtown East is a popular choice for meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) with various entertainment entities available at the same destination.</p>

						<p>Downtown East's laidback ambience, complete with resort facilities for a quick getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life, makes it a perfect venue for company retreats or team-bonding sessions. With all the fun stuff under one roof, organising Family Days at Downtown East is a breeze.</p>

						<p>D'Marquee and D'Tent are air-conditioned exhibition areas that can hold up to almost 800 pax for buffet or 4,000 standing concert-goers. Begonia Pavilion features five function rooms and a terrace. Maximum capacity can go up to about 1,100 guests.</p>
						
						<h3>Iconic Events</h3>

						<p>Make the most of your "staycation" at Costa Sands Resorts, and enjoy a variety of water rides at Wild Wild Wet. Interactive fun awaits children at Professor's Playground, Yippee!, while those in for an adventure get their thrills from Ular-lah (Super Flume), Slide Up and The Waterworks. Besides featuring 32 lanes for adults and youths, Orchid Bowl @ E!hub has miniature bowling facilities to start toddlers and children with an early grip of the game. The Highway 66 Miniature Bowling comes with shorter lanes, automated bumpers and a lighter ball. It is imported from the United States and is the first of its kind, not just in Singapore but in Southeast Asia. Players can bowl with their children here, without the need to wear bowling shoes.</p>

						<p>Juniors under 12 won't need to be persuaded to check out eXplorerkid - the largest indoor playground in Singapore, with a variety of interactive and challenging play stations such as The Cliff (rock climbing) and Adventure Highlands (rope course with suspension bridge). There is even a ball pool specially catered for toddlers.</p>
