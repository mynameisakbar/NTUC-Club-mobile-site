						<h3>More than just a good game of golf</h3>
						<p>Marina Bay Golf Course is Singapore's only 18-hole public golf course and one of Asia's best public golf courses. Located strategically in the heart of town, the course offers golfers great accessibility and a picturesque view of the city skyline, be it day or night.</p>

						<p>Being the only links-styled golf course in Singapore, the design of the par 72 course attempts to connect to the history of golf - traditional links of Scotland and the beginning of golf - with its few water hazards and in particular, its 91 pot bunkers. These bunkers not only serve as one of our dramatic features, they are also geared to provide hours of challenges and excitement to golfers.</p>

						<p>Besides being one of the few golf courses in Singapore to offer night golfing from Wednesday to Friday for busy executives, Marina Bay Golf Course also offers golfers an enhanced golfing experience through the use of the Global Positioning System on its full fleet of buggies.</p>

						<p>The four-tier driving range with 146 bays is the biggest and the longest driving range in Singapore. The driving range is open from 7am to 10.45pm all days, except on Monday mornings. The course also offers four practice greens for golfers.</p>
