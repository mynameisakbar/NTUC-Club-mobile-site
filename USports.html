						<h3>Bringing together a community of <br/>sports enthusiast</h3>
						<p>U Sports was set up to engage sports enthusiasts and their families and friends. It provides a comprehensive and packed calendar of sports-related events and activities. Those who have a common passion for sports can come together and actively nurture new friendships. Initiatives such as the various sports interest groups and mass events, leagues and competitions such as the U Games, the iconic inter-union, multi-sport tournament are also in place to encourage sustained participation among members. U Sports aims to increase outreach and create opportunities for union members to enhance interaction and forge a community built on strong ties of friendship and a fervour for sports.</p>
