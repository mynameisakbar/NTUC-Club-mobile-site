						<h3>Power of Youth</h3>
						<p>nEbO was launched on 7 July 2007 to bridge the gap between youths aged 12 to 21 and the Labour Movement. As nEbO aims to create a community of Work-Ready, World-Ready and Life-Ready youths, members are given the opportunity to hone their leadership skills and develop their potential. Activists take on leadership roles in nEbO, initiating, planning and leading events for other members, creating a vibrant community powered by youth, for youth.</p>
						
						<p>We strive to be the preferred social movement of the youths by producing productive workers of tomorrow, and developing future leaders for the Labour Movement.</p>
						
						<h3>The Youth Platform</h3>
						<p>Through nEbO, youths get to develop their interests and potential through the 24 interest groups under the six communities (Entrepreneurship, Sports, Care, Music & Events, Lifestyle, Gaming). They also get to hone their leadership qualities by planning and organizing community-related activities with the support and guidance from nEbO advisors.</p>
					
						<h3>The Youth Platform</h3>
						<p>Since its launch in 2007, nEbO has come to establish many key initiatives that continue to evolve and enhance exposure for our youth members, such as learning journeys to organisations and corporations from varied industries. An iconic annual event is The Quest, which aims to educate youths on the Labour Movement and its causes while bringing them together in a spirit of fun and learning. Another major event is the Youth Entrepreneurship Symposium (YES), which sees junior college students coming together to explore multifaceted entrepreneurship issues creatively. Participants also get to interact with and learn from guest entrepreneur speakers.</p>
						<p>Partnering with various academic institutions and voluntary welfare organisations, our youths champion ‘care’ initiatives such as outings for children and seniors, food distribution to the less-privileged and more.</p>
						
						<h3>Work-Ready, World-Ready & Life-Ready</h3>
						<p>As the junior membership of the Labour Movement, nEbO strives to engage youths, who will form the future workforce of Singapore. The aim is to create a community of Work-Ready, World-Ready and Life-Ready youths.</p>
						<h3>-Work-ready</h3><p>To ease their transition to working life, nEbO has been partnering various unions and organisations to organise learning journeys. nEbOians gain an insight into the daily operations of various organisations, the career opportunities available, learn the roles of unions and how they play a part in protecting the interests of workers.</p>
						<h3>-World-ready</h3><p>Events are organised to help youths acquire the skills and networks needed to compete in a globalised economy. For instance, educational events such as the Youth Entrepreneurship Symposium encourage nEbOians to come together, generate new ideas, while connecting them with other successful entrepreneurs and business leaders.</p>

						<h3>-Life-ready</h3><p>nEbOians are encouraged to take on leadership roles within the community and given opportunities to plan and organise activities. To instill a sense of social responsibility among youths, nEbO organises care events that allow them to volunteer their services.<br/>For upcoming exciting nEbO events, please visit www.nEbO.sg.<br/>Be a fan of nEbO on Facebook for the latest updates!</p>
