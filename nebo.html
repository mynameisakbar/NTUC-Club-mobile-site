						<h3>Power of Youth</h3>
						<p>nEbO was launched on 7 July 2007 to bridge the gap between youths aged 12 to 21 and the Labour Movement. As nEbO aims to create a community of Work-Ready, World-Ready and Life-Ready youths, members are given the opportunity to hone their leadership skills and develop their potential. Activists take on leadership roles in nEbO, initiating, planning and leading events for other members, creating a vibrant community powered by youth, for youth.</p>
						
						<p>We strive to be the preferred social movement of the youths by producing productive workers of tomorrow, and developing future leaders for the Labour Movement.</p>
