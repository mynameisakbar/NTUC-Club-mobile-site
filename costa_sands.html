						<p>Located in the eastern part of Singapore, Costa Sands Resort (Downtown East) is a popular choice holiday destination for Singaporeans. It is the favourite resort getaway closer to home. Over the years, more facilities have been added to enhance the resort experience. Guests can now do a self check-in through the kiosks at the reception and breeze pass the queues at the check-in counter. Every room booked comes with a BBQ pit. There are also pro-family rooms available upon requests (subject to availability).</p>

						<p>The elevated five-lane, 50-metre long swimming pool, a first in Singapore with see-through panels on its sides and bottom, allows resort guests to wave to their family members and friends when having fun swimming. Visitors are also spoilt for choice when it comes to food. The adjacent Downtown East is a gastronomic paradise with more than 40 outlets offering a kaleidoscope of food, ranging from food court dining to fast food joints to specialty restaurants. E!hub, a five-storey integrated lifestyle and entertainment centre located within th Downtown East landscape, comprises a cinema, a bowling centre and an indoor children playground - eXplorerkid. Our very own 25-metre tall indoor Ferris Wheel, another first of its kind in Singapore, is also housed in E!hub.</p>

Escape Theme Park, Singapore's first world-class theme park, is only a stone's throw away. It features 14 exhilarating rides and popular walk-through attraction, "Haunted II", which just underwent a facelift to provide more frightful fun for the brave ones. </p>

						<p>Wild Wild Wet is the largest water theme park in Singapore. Ular-lah, the first raft slide in South East Asia, is the key attraction. Each raft seats six people and you can expect high-banked corners and 360 degree spins as you race to the finish line. Other thrilling rides include the Slide Up, a 11m high valley-shaped slide and the Waterworks, which consist of wacky curves and crazy turnings. For the less adventurous, enjoy comfortable rides in the Tsunami Wave Pool and Shiok River.</p>
