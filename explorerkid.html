						<h2>Learn and explore the world with little<br/> ones on-board</h2>
						<p>eXplorerkid is a family-friendly club for families with children aged 12 and younger. We operate the largest Indoor Playground in Singapore, eXplorerkid @ E!hub, in Downtown East. eXplorerkid is part of NTUC Club the leisure and entertainment arm of the Labour Movement. There are fun and challenging play stations for kids, and relaxation facilities for accompanying parents and guardians.</p>

						<p>At eXplorerkid, we encourage learning through exploration. To transport our young to a fantasy world of learning and discovery, the eXplorerkid Indoor Children Playground is a highly-tactile playground designed around a mystical forest theme. As the children explore the eXplorerkid Indoor Playground's Mystical Forest, they are exposed to fun-play obstacles and educational elements.</p>

						<p>Besides the Indoor Playground, eXplorerkid offers the following products and services: Membership, School Field Trips, Themed Birthday Parties, Events, Activities and a retail Fun Shop.</p>

						<p>We run an attractive ongoing membership programme to encourage families with children under 12 years and below to join us as members of the extended NTUC family.</p>

						<h3>Admission and Play Rates</h3>
						<p>Charges for children under 12 vary accordingly to the playtime. NTUC and eXplorerkid members enjoy attractive year-round discounts in play rates.</p>

						<p>The full-day and per-hour play rates cover playtime at the standard play stations. There are two play stations (Adventure Highlands and Ball‘O’City) that charge separate playtime fees.</p>

						<p>Any expenses incurred at the adult-only facilities are charged accordingly.</p>

						<p>Socks must be worn at all times by all visitors in eXplorerkid Indoor Playground. Shoes are to be deposited at the Shoe Store before entering the Playground. Visitors are encouraged to bring their own socks or they can buy a pair for $2.50 at the entrance.</p>
