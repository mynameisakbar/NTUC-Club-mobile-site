						<p>Between the undulating masses of gyrating hips borne from Akon's chart topping numbers to the majestic guitar solos flowing off at Dragonforce's concert, Quebec Leisure was entrenched behind the scenes, grinding out the painstaking legwork with all the precision required to facilitate such superscalar productions. That, in essence, is what we take pride in our business of entertaining YOU. Just the wonder of children witnessing the blazing pyrotechnics of The Greatest Show or laughing at former cirque du soleil clowns' slapstick antics at Aga-Boom inspire us to expound our commitment to excellent service with utmost vigor. We don't just manage events, we craft them.  From assembling the greatest of staging structures to ushering in whole constellations of world-class performers, we are there at every step of the way to guarantee an immersive and epic experience. Be it your event or our own, a modest corporate dinner to a fanfare of music and culture like the Singapore International Salsa Festival, we will do whatever it takes to make it a monumental success.</p>

						<p>Putting our recent creations into perspective, it is hard to believe, that once, in 1982, we were only a humble mobile disco operation.  Motivated with the finesse and passion we deliver for every project, we are now armed to the teeth with an arsenal bristling with state-of-the-art sound and lighting systems and venues such as Downtown East, DXO at the Esplanade, Union Square, Jest D'place, Happy Days and the latest addition: Scarlet City, an oriental themed club.</p>
