						<h3>Get wet and splashy in the East</h3>
						<p>Opened in 2004, Wild Wild Wet is Singapore's first water park. We promise you a day of thrills and spills for the whole family. Situated at Downtown East, it remains one of the most popular family attractions in Singapore by NTUC Club. From adrenalin-pumping rides to relaxing and gentle ones, visitors are guaranteed a fun-filled day while they beat the heat.</p>

						<p>Amidst the fun, our guests' safety remains our top priority. Various inflatable floats customised for different rides ensure adventures come with safety in mind as well. To enhance safety, life jackets are available for free usage for adults and children. Baby water carriers are also available for free to allow parents to have a splashing good time with their infants. Our lifeguards are specially trained in stringent international standards for lifeguarding at water-based attractions.</p>

						<p>Not only do children's parties at Wild Wild Wet guarantee a memorable experience for the little ones, it also makes for a very unique location for company functions. Singaporean and PR senior citizens above 55 years of age, as well as toddlers below the age of three enjoy free admission. Family packages are also available.</p>
