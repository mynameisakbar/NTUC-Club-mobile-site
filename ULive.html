						<h3>A Lifestyle Community for Active Agers</h3>
						<p>Launched in July 2009, U Live is an exclusive platform to reach out to active agers 55 years and above. This vibrant community is all about staying connected with family and friends through numerous activities and living an active lifestyle. The tagline "The Good Life" further signifies the new chapter in the lives of our active agers, where they can look forward to many more productive and purposeful years ahead, enjoying a happy and healthy life with emphasis on social, intellectual, physical, vocational, emotional and spiritual wellness.</p>
						<p>Through various Work, Live and Play initiatives like re-employment schemes, cause-centric programmes, and age-specific interest groups and privileges, U Live hopes to encourage active agers to remain employed, enriched and engaged. In addition to new work opportunities and exciting lifestyle and life skill activities, U Live also allows our active agers to maintain their association with the Labour Movement.</p>
