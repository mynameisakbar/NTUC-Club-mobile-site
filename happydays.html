						<h2>Happy Days</h2>
						<p>Sleekness and vibrancy are the epitomes of this clubhouse, which is slated for the Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs). On weekdays, we entertain with a series of ambient and live acoustic performances while our clubbers sip on our crisp imported beers or choose from our smorgasbord of new and old world wines from Australia, Italy, France, Chile, South Africa and California.</p>
						 
						<p>One can either enjoy a good ol' challenge at darts, foosball or pool or just chill comfortably, watching one's favourite soccer matches on the large screen. Free wifi is provided for the busy professionals as well.</p>
						 
						<p>Happy Days was initially opened in the heartlands of Bishan in November 1995. It relocated to Bedok Princess Theatre in December 2009, occupying a queenly 10,000 sq feet including a lounge and function room</p>
